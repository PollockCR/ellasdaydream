There are people that you meet in life who instantly impact it in unimaginable ways. You are one of those people. Thank you for radiating sunshine in a way I have never seen before. You are an inspiration to me, and everyone else you meet. Your positive attitude, creative mind, and loving heart is what sets you apart from everyone else. I have never met a soul that shines brighter than you. I will cherish every memory and adventure we have shared together. All the late-night dancing and shenanigans. You truly have impacted me in ways that I did not think were possible.  

From the crazy nights in Vegas to eating watermelon like savages on the hill at LiB, you truly made every adventure exponentially better. You are one of a kind, and I am so grateful to have been able to share this life with you. You really are everything that is beautiful in this world. I know wherever you are there is great music, dancing, and glitter everywhere. I will be waiting for the day we reunite on the dance floor somewhere through time and space. Thank you for being such an incredible person. Thank you for being such an incredible friend. I will treasure you forever my Ella sunshine. You have changed my life in so many ways. You will continue to inspire me in everything I do.  

My fashion icon and glitter queen.. your light will continue to shine on through eternity.   

Until we dance again.
