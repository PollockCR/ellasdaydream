Ella,

It’s been a month since you’ve passed & you are on my mind everyday. We shared such a special friendship. I could always count on you for anything. You were one of my biggest supporters & always let me know how proud you were of me for my accomplishments. I am so honored and proud to have been able know you & love you. You were the brightest ray of sunshine & everyone’s favorite friend. We have countless memories that I will cherish forever but our very last memory will always hold a special place in my heart. We spent the day boating in Lake Tahoe & together we jumped off the boat & floated in the water as though we were mermaids. We spent over an hour floating, soaking up the sun, and catching up on each other’s lives. You have impacted my life in unimaginable ways. Thank you for your kind hearted spirit, your vibrant personality, and your ability to radiate positivity in any situation. You changed my life forever & I will spend the rest of my days living in your honor. I miss you more than you could ever imagine. All my love, always. Rest easy angel baby. May your next life be filled with all things eccentric. Until we dance together again my glitter queen.
