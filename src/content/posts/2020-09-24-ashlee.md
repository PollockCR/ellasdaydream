I met Ella through our mutual friend, Ali & Ella was a force to be reckoned with. Everything about ella’s energy screamed LOVE. The picture I included is my room wall right now, surrounded my ella’s beautiful artwork. To know the sun has set on Ella’s time has me torn inside. The last message I sent to Ella was a video about hoping she wins in life. Seeing the love and support behind Ella shows me she had already won. I love you Ella I hope your spirit blesses the earth because we need that sunshine to shine bright on us ❤️
