Iâ€™ve written and re-written this post hundreds of times. Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that I canâ€™t properly put into words the heart-wrenching, soul shattering feeling weâ€™re all experiencing right now. Your essence could never be summarized by only photos, memories, and kind words. Your earth adventure was only beginning.

Ella bae, I wish this was all a nightmare we could wake up from. That youâ€™d answer our Group FaceTime and everything would be normal, even if it was just for a second. You have always been so unapologetically yourself, Iâ€™ve adored that about you from the moment we met. You showered everyone you knew with limitless amounts of love and happiness. Itâ€™s impossible to feel down when youâ€™re around. No matter how bad the day is going, you knew exactly how to turn it around. You radiate joy so brightly, you dazzle each and every person you meet. Every life that you enter with style and grace; you change indefinitely. You are the human embodiment of love, glitter, rainbows, sunshine and everything nice and beautiful in this world. You are Earthâ€™s only true angel. Whenever I see a pink sunset, a cute animal, or anything involving a disco ball, Iâ€™ll think of you and smile.  Itâ€™s incredible how many things I see you in. I canâ€™t thank you enough for all of the times we have shared. The laughs, the hugs, the festivals, the vacations, the art projects, the late nights, the next morning talks. The sincerity of every word you spoke will resonate with me forever. Thank you for making life magical. I know youâ€™re dancing in the clouds somewhere surrounded by radiant colors, glitter, kick ass music and beanie babies. You probably have a mimosa in one hand and are petting puppies with the other.

I love you my angel. I wish more than anything I could see your beautiful smile, or hear your cute ass excited voice one more time. Itâ€™s been playing over and over in my head. This world is sparkle-less without you in it. Through this life and the next, I love and treasure you infinitely. Nug buds 4 life. Ellaâ€™s day dream forever. ðŸ¦„ðŸ’žðŸ’œðŸŒˆ
