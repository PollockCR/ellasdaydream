As I’ve been processing this unimaginable information given to my family just a few days ago I’ve had the chance to reflect on my childhood and my time growing up with sweet Ella as my big sister. I’ve always known Ella was a one of a kind soul, and these last few days have done nothing but confirm that. No one was doing life like Ella. She wasn’t scared to be her true self. She befriended anyone and everyone, no matter their quirks. I couldn’t have had a better example to look up to.

The stories and memories everyone has been messaging me has brought me nothing but happiness. I’m so blessed to have a sister who impacted so many peoples lives. Growing up, it seemed like anywhere and everywhere I went I got asked “omg are you Ella Hamrick’s sister?!” And once I would say yes they would instantly tell me how amazing she is and how lucky I am to have her as a sister.

I’ve had the chance to find hundreds of pictures I’ve never seen of us from childhood. It’s brought me so much happiness. It made me realize how much fun it was growing up with you. It seemed we were up at Sand Harbor just about everyday of summer. Climbing the rocks and jumping off together. Those have always been my favorite memories. And I couldn’t be more thankful that our last days together just a couple weeks ago we’re filled of just that. Staying at Sand Harbor till sundown, climbing the rocks, jumping off, and swimming out to the buoy.

I miss you so much, Ella. We couldn’t have been more different, but that’s what made us great. I’ve always tried to be as kind hearted as you and I will continue to do just that and even more. I don’t know what I’ll do without your FaceTime calls when I’m having mental breakdowns, but I will always remember all the advice you’ve given me as I’m transitioning into adulthood and try to think of what you would say to me. I love you long time.

-your brat of a sister
