Ella, you were the brightest light I’ve ever known. You were the sweetest, kindest person. Everyone that ever met you couldn’t help but feel drawn to your bubbly energy and would likely start to vibe with you especially if they met you on the dance floor. It still doesn’t feel real that you’re gone. I still want to face time you & share our lives and secrets. I cherish how we would always make an effort to check in with one another. I still want to plan another fun trip or music festival with you. I want to see you do something spectacular with your artistic self. I want you to meet Maui. I know how much love you had for animals and all creatures in general. There’s so much you needed to see and do. My heart is broken knowing that you won’t be able to but I find comfort knowing that in your short time here you LIVED. You saw and did so much. We made so many epic memories from cheerleading in high school, Mardi Gras, Coachellas, Desert hearts, San Francisco trips and many more. You blessed every single life you touched. I am so grateful that I could even know you. You always called me out on my shit and I needed that. I will be better in this life for you. You cared so much about the world. When I lived far from downtown, I would go to your house & would crawl into your bed with you to stay the night even if we weren’t even hanging out that night. You just wanted me to be safe. One of the last conversations we had I sent you an article about how they found a kid floating on a unicorn in the ocean. It could have been you. You’re a real life unicorn. The way you are and everything you embody - the rarest of them all. I’ll see you in my dreams. I’ll see you in the signs of synchronized numbers, a coin on the ground, shooting stars, a butterfly or a bird feather. I will feel you in a song. I know you’ll be with me. I have an 😇 watching over me. I love you so fucking much Ella. I hope you’re resting somewhere with beanie babies, house music and where the 🧜🏻‍♀️ are. Rest In Peace baby
