Hello beloved family and friends of Ella, 
 
We have organized a Celebration of Life for our sweet angel. Although gone far too soon, she lived an extraordinary life filled with love and compassion, creativity, and vibrant energy.  Ella loved and appreciated everyone in her life dearly, come celebrate her vibrant existence with us. 
 
 
As many of you know, Ella was an amazing artist who created mystical collages. We will have **prints available for donations** for those of you who would like to take a piece of her art home with you. The money from the **donations will go to her family** to help in this time of need, as well as to help with Molly's medical expenses. 
 
 
 Due to the unfortunate circumstances of **COVID-19**, we have made this an all day event with the intentions of **people stopping by throughout the day** as they please to help limit the amount of people all together at once. With that being said, please adhere to standard COVID precautions (please **wear a mask**). We want to keep this event safe and prevent the spread of virus as best as we can.
 
 
In Ella's honor, please wear anything eccentric with rainbows, sparkles, glitter, etc. This is a celebration her life, we are gathering together to remember a wonderful friend, daughter, and sister who has greatly impacted each and everyone of our lives.
 
 
We realize that Ella impacted so many people who we may not have contact with. Feel welcome to add anyone to this event who knew Ella and would like to join. 
 
 
This event will be held at Rancho San Rafael Park, we are in the process of reserving a Pavilion - more details to follow regarding exact location soon. 
 
Please RSVP as soon as possible.
