Everyday was a beautiful day with Ella. One memory that always sticks out was back in 2015 at Life is Beautiful. Marina, Ella, and myself were watching Run the Jewels at the end of the festival when we received a text that the Killers announced that they are reuniting and they are going to start performing. Without hesitation the three of us ran from the opposite side of the venue to where the Killers were performing. Once we made it to the stage we skipped, danced, and jumped our way to the beat of “All the things that I’ve done.” Even before hearing the news of Ella this is a memory that I hold onto dearly. It was pure joy and happiness as the three of us hopped through the crowd singing along to the lyrics. We were all smiles and life really was beautiful. Her spirit has been and always will be so bright. That song will always remind me of her. It will always remind me of all the other memories that followed that weekend. Listening to the song last night after the news reminded me, “if you can’t hold on, hold on.”

I’ll hold onto her in my heart forever. I wish we could have just one more dance, hug, and to share one last tear of happiness together. You’re already missed. I know when a rainbow is in the sky, you’ll be saying hello Ella. Until we meet again sweet angel. Xoxo
